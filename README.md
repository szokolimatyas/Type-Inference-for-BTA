# type-inference-for-bta

Implementation of two different algorithms using type inference for the purpose of binding-time analysis.

The original algorithm first appeared in https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/91556.91672.

Martin Grabmueller's work on implementing W in Haskell was used as inspiration and basis in parts of the source code.
